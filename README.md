# ESP8266 Java Library

This is a Java class library that wraps communication functionalty of the ESP8266 AT command firmware. The ESP8266 class implements the capability by abstracting communication from to an OS (or lack of one) serial port. The constructor takes InputStream and OutputStream to the serial port. The ./samples directory has implementation examples that demonstrate calling the library from a Windows/Mac/Linux operating system. Also the ./boards directory demonstrates communicating with embedded boards, like the Raspberry Pi, with no operating system.

This work is a work in progress.
